# STAT390 Project: Predicting Daily New COVID-19 Cases in Countries with Top 10 GDP per capita

This project aimed to model and predict the number of daily new COVID-19 cases in countries that ranked in the top ten in terms of GDP per capita using time-series models and classical gradient boost trees. This repository contains all the files for this project, except for the dataset due to size restrictions. The datasets after data preprocessing (after the intermediate demo) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RUcb0Ouiepp-CFQrZejtyy2nOjcIl2lf?usp=drive_link).
